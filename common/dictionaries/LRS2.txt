THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH THEM
THE FIRST STAGE IS MASHING
AND BEING GIVEN HEAVY METAL POISONS
WAS FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE
MISS FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE IS NOW STAYING AT DR GULLY'S WATER CURE ESTABLISHMENT IN MALVERN
SHE WAS VERY WELL KNOWN BECAUSE HER FAMILY WERE VERY
BUT SHE WASN'T QUITE SURE WHAT THAT WORK SHOULD BE
AFTER THE CRIMEAN WAR
AND FOR ESTABLISHING NURSING AS A TRUE PROFESSION
WHEN SHE VISITED HERE
SHE WAS ACTUALLY LOOKING FOR A CURE FOR HERSELF
BUT SHE WASN'T VERY WELL THEN
THERE WAS ONLY ONE MISS NIGHTINGALE IN THE WHOLE WORLD THEN
SO EVERYBODY FOUND OUT WHERE SHE WAS AND ALL THE NEWSPAPERS SAID
HE WAS VERY CLEVER
THE WHOLE FAMILY WERE VERY WORRIED
IS THERE ARE NO COLOURS OR LIGHTS THAT STAND OUT
AM I WRITING THEIR MUSIC
ON HIS DEATHBED
I WAS HELPED AT THE BEGINNING BY A COMMITTEE
JUST TURN UP BETWEEN CERTAIN HOURS
I DO A SHORT SHOW ON DEMAND
AND THEREFORE PROBABLY MAGICALLY
AND TO SACRIFICE IT IN THE EVENT OF A GERMAN INVASION
SO IN THE FUTURE
BUT HOW WELL THEY WERE PREPARED AS WELL
AND BIRMINGHAM BEING THE GREAT INDUSTRIAL AREA SINCE VICTORIAN TIMES WITH THE BLACK COUNTRY
EVEN CIVILIAN THINGS LIKE GAS MASKS AND THINGS LIKE THAT
DEFEND THE RIVERBANK
BUT OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS
WE'VE MANAGED TO GATHER A LOT MORE INFORMATION
WINSTON CHURCHILL WAS PRIME MINISTER WHEN IT WAS FIRST BROADCAST
AND REVOLVES AROUND A FARMING FAMILY
SURELY YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS BY NOW
BUT IF YOU STILL HAD ANY DOUBTS
IT'S BROADCAST ON BBC RADIO 4 FROM SUNDAYS TO FRIDAYS
BECAUSE WE RECORD 24 EPISODES IN SIX DAYS
WHICH IS A MONTH'S AIR TIME
WE'RE NOT IN EACH OTHER'S POCKETS EVERY DAY
EVERYONE HAS ENTANGLEMENTS
AND THEN WHEN WE GOT OFF IN LONDON SAID
THE ARCHERS LOST ITS EDUCATIONAL PURPOSE IN 1972
BUT STILL PRIDES ITSELF IN ITS REFLECTION OF RURAL LIFE
THAT LOVABLE ROGUE
AND IT TAKES A LOT MORE THAN I IMAGINED
